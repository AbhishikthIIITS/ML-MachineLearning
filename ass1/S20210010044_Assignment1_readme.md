-->The python code implements a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (k-NNC) for wine quality classification.

-->It loads training and test data from CSV files and calculates distances using Euclidean and Manhattan metrics.

-->Predictions are made based on k nearest neighbors, and accuracy is calculated for k=1 and k=3.

-->The 'accuracy_report.txt' file is generated, reporting accuracy, correct predictions, and total predictions.

-->Functions handle data normalization, mean and standard deviation calculation, and data shuffling for validation.

-->The script concludes by writing author information, assignment details, and results to the report file.

-->This code demonstrates fundamental k-NNC concepts, data manipulation, and reporting techniques.
